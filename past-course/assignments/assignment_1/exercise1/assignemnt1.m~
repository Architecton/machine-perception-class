% The image consists of three channels (Red, Green and Blue)

% At first glance, there is no substantial difference between the two
% functions used to display the image. We will demonstrate the difference
% between them later on.

% Convert the color image into a grayscale one by averaging all three
% channels.

A_gray = uint8(Ad(:,:,1) + Ad(:,:,2) + Ad(:,:,3) / 3.0);

% (A similar effect can be achieved by using the built-in rgb2gray function)

% Cut out a rectangular sub-image and display it as a new image. Mark the
% same region in the original image by settig its thrid (blue) color
% channel to 0 and displaying the modified image.

A1 = A;
A1(130:260, 240:450, 3) = 0;	% Set blue channel in marked region to zero.
figure;
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imshow(A1);
A2 = A(130:260, 240:450, 1);	% Cut out section from image.
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imshow(A2);

% Display a grayscale image that has a region negated (values are inverted)
A3 = A_gray;
A3(130:260, 240:450) = 255 - A3(130:260, 240:450);

imshow(A3);

% Calculate a new image by multiplying the elements of the original image
% with appropriate factor (and then round the result). Choose the
% multiplication factor so that the resulting image will have the highest
% possible grayscale level 63 (the lowest remains 0).

% Explain the difference between imagesc and imshow by observing the
% results of displaying this new image.
