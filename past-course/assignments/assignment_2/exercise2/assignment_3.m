% (a) %% 
% Write a function gaussfilter.m, that generates a Gaussian filter and applies it to
% a 2D image taking into account that the kernel is separable. Instead of the conv
% function use its analogy in 2D space, conv2. Generate a 1D kernel and use it to filter
% the image in the first dimension (Ib = conv2(I, g, 'same')) and then in the second
% dimension simply by transposing the kernel (Ig = conv2(Ib, g' ,'same')). Test
% the function by using the code snippet below that loads a reference image lena.png,
% transforms it to grayscale and corrupts it with a Gaussian noise (pixel value offset
% by a random number, sampled from a Gaussian distribution), as well as the salt-
% and-pepper noise (a portion of randomly selected pixels set to the lowest, black, or
% highest, white, value). Then the code uses the gaussfilter function (with sigma = 1 )
% to filter both corrupted images.

% see gaussfilter.m

% Testing the written function:
A = rgb2gray(imread('lena.png'));
Icg = imnoise(A,'gaussian', 0, 0.01); % Gaussian noise
figure;
subplot(2,2,1); imshow(Icg); colormap gray;
axis equal; axis tight; title('Gaussian noise');
Ics = imnoise(A,'salt & pepper', 0.1); % Salt & pepper noise
subplot(2,2,2) ; imshow(uint8(Ics)); colormap gray;
axis equal; axis tight; title('Salt and pepper');
Icg_b = gaussfilter(double(Icg), 1);
Ics_b = gaussfilter(double(Ics), 1);
subplot(2,2,3) ; imshow(uint8(Icg_b)); colormap gray;
axis equal; axis tight; title('Filtered') ;
subplot(2,2,4) ; imshow(uint8(Ics_b)); colormap gray;
axis equal; axis tight; title('Filtered');

% Question: Which noise is better removed using the Gaussian filter?

% (b) %%
% Another useful filter that you have heard about at the lectures is sharpening filter.
%
% Look for its formulation in the slides, implement it and test it on image museum.jpg .
% What do you notice?


% (c) %%
% Implement a nonlinear median lter that has also been mentioned at the lectures. In
% comparison Gaussian lter computes a locally weighted average values to compute
% a weighted mean of the signal, the median lter sorts the signal values in the given
% filter window and uses the middle value of the sorted sequence (a median) as a local
% result. Implement a simple median lter as a function simple_median , that takes
% an input signal I and a width of the ler W as an input and returns a ltered signal.

% Use the snippet below to test the function. It generates a 1 D step signal and corrupts
% it using the salt-and-pepper noise and then lters it using the Gaussian and median
% filter that you have implemented. Set the parameters of the lters that they would
% achieve the best reconstruction result.

% Question: Which filter performs better at this specic task? In comparison to
% Gaussian lter that can be applied multiple times in any order, does the order
% matter in case of median lter? What is the name of lters like this?


% (d) %%
% (5 points) Implement a 2 -D version of the median lter and test it on an im-
% age, corrupted by a Gaussian noise as well as the salt-and-pepper noise. Compare
% the results with the Gaussian lter for multiple noise intensities as well as lter
% sizes. Compare (analytically estimate) what is the computation complexity of the
% Gaussian lter operation and what is the computational complexity of the median
%filter using the O(Â·) notation. (in the median lter we use the quicksort algorithm to
% perform sorting.

% (e) %%
% (5 points) Implement the hybrid image approach that was presented at lectures.
% To do this you also have to implement the Laplacian lter, lter two images (one
% with Gaussian and one with Laplacian lter) and combine them together. You can
% use images cat1.jpg and cat2.jpg as a reference since they are both of the same
% size. Do not convert them to grayscale, simply apply the same operations to all three
% channels and display the result as a color image.
